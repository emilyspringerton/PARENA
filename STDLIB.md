# PARENA Standard Library — design

**Status:** Design only. Nothing implemented — VS0 (`parena-c`) doesn't have a `defn`/`import`
resolver yet, so none of this can run. This document exists so the package boundaries are decided
*before* the region analyzer and emitter get built against them, not invented ad hoc later.

Founder: "PARENA needs a standard library like the golang one." Go's stdlib is the reference
point, applied at the level that actually transfers to a region-typed, multi-target language:
small, single-purpose packages; consistent per-package naming (`pkg.Func`-style, here
`pkg/func`); few surprises; `io`/`os`/`strings`/`fmt`-shaped coverage before anything exotic.
What does *not* transfer directly: Go's stdlib assumes a GC and no region system, so every
function signature below carries real `@ Region` annotations, not decoration.

## Real constraint this design has to satisfy

Five stdlib calls already exist as **real, load-bearing code** in `NORTHSTAR.md`'s own core-idiom
and VS0 examples — copied from the source spec document, not invented for this design pass:

```clojure
(string/parse-i32 input)                          ; safe-parse-int
(io/write-string !file "Operation completed\n")    ; write-log-and-close
(io/close !file)                                   ; write-log-and-close
(log/info "Parsed integer:" val)                   ; safe-parse-int
(buffer/set-data buf-arena bad-str)                ; VS0 test.prn's own invalid-escape example
```

Every package below either contains one of these five verbatim (with a real, specific type
signature now) or is new — and every new package is justified against something VS0's own DoD
or NORTHSTAR.md's own examples already need, not spec-crept in.

## Package list

### `core` — always in scope, no `import` needed

The handful of things every `.prn` file needs without asking for them, same role Go's
predeclared identifiers (`len`, `error`, `int`, `nil`) play.

- `(Option T)`, `(Result T E)` — the tagged unions `match` destructures (NORTHSTAR §"Zero-
  allocation pattern matching"). `Ok`/`Err`/`Some`/`None` constructors.
- `Arena`, `with-arena` — already core forms per NORTHSTAR's own "Declarations & bindings" and
  "Memory model" sections, not a package function, listed here only so this doc's own package
  list is complete.

### `io` — the two calls the source spec already uses, plus their obvious neighbors

```clojure
(defn write-string [(!f : FileHandle @ :region/task) (s : String @ :region/scratch)]
  : (Result Unit IoError) @ :region/scratch)

(defn close [(!f : FileHandle @ :region/task)]
  : (Result Unit IoError) @ :region/scratch)

(defn open [(path : String @ :region/scratch) (mode : OpenMode)]
  : (Result FileHandle IoError) @ :region/task)

(defn read-string [(!f : FileHandle @ :region/task) (buf : Arena @ :region/buffer)]
  : (Result String IoError) @ :region/buffer)
```

`write-string`/`close` take `!f` (linear) matching the source document's own
`write-log-and-close` example exactly — the region analyzer's move/ownership invariant is what
makes "write after close" a compile error, not a runtime check `io` has to perform itself.
`open`/`read-string` are the obvious symmetric operations no `io` package could ship without,
grounded in the same `FileHandle` type the source examples already assume exists.

**`io` extension — binary reads** (grounded in porting `gpt2-alpine-c`, below): its real weight
loader (`gpt2.c`'s `fread_or_fail`) does raw `fread(buf, sizeof(float), n, f)` — a checkpoint file
is just a flat sequence of `float32`s read straight into a buffer, no string decoding involved.
`read-string` alone can't express that.

```clojure
(defn read-floats [(!f : FileHandle @ :region/task) (n : I32) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Result NDArray IoError) @ Region)   ; reads n raw F32 values, same "region caller picks" idiom
```

Returns `array`'s own `NDArray` directly (1-D, `shape = [n]`) rather than a bare `(Vec F64)` —
model weights are immediately going to be reshaped and matmul'd, so handing back the type
`linalg` already operates on avoids a pointless intermediate conversion step.

### `string` — one real call, plus the minimum a "no arrays yet but has Strings" language needs

```clojure
(defn parse-i32 [(s : String @ :region/scratch)]
  : (Result I32 ParseError) @ :region/scratch)

(defn length [(s : String @ :region/scratch)] : I32)
(defn concat [(a : String @ Region) (b : String @ Region) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : String @ Region)
(defn split [(s : String @ :region/scratch) (sep : String @ :region/scratch) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Vec String) @ Region)
```

`parse-i32` is verbatim from the source spec (`safe-parse-int`'s own body). `length`/`concat`/
`split` are the minimum any language ships before its first real program can be written that
does more than log a fixed string — deliberately small, not a full `strings`-package-worth of
surface, matching "yolo like php" over speccing every function up front.

### `log` — one real call

```clojure
(defn info  [(msg : String @ Region) (args : &Any ...)])
(defn warn  [(msg : String @ Region) (args : &Any ...)])
(defn error [(msg : String @ Region) (args : &Any ...)])
```

`info` is verbatim from the source spec. `warn`/`error` are the obvious same-shape siblings —
not adding a full leveled-logging framework (formatters, sinks, structured fields) until
something real needs one.

### `buffer` — one real call, the arena-adjacent operations `Arena`/`with-arena` alone don't cover

```clojure
(defn set-data [(!buf : Arena @ :region/buffer) (data : String @ Region)]
  : (Result Unit RegionError) @ :region/buffer)

(defn get-data [(buf : Arena @ :region/buffer)] : (Option String) @ :region/buffer)
```

`set-data` is verbatim from VS0's own `test.prn` (both the valid and the deliberately-invalid
example call it). `get-data` is the obvious read-side counterpart — without it, `buffer` would
be a write-only package, which no real stdlib package is.

### `array` / `linalg` / `stats` — the numpy/scipy equivalent

Founder: "can we build scipy and numpy into the standard language of PARENA?" → "whatever the
equivalent would be" → "build building blocks as stdlib if you need to or if it helps" → "to keep
things nice and composible." Real design, not a wholesale port of numpy/scipy's own API surface —
those two libraries are themselves layered (numpy: the array type + memory layout; scipy: linear
algebra/stats/optimization/signal-processing *built on top of* numpy's array), and that layering
is exactly the "nice and composable" shape to reuse: three small packages, each usable alone,
each `import`able without pulling in the others.

**`array`** — the actual numpy-equivalent: one region-typed, contiguous N-dimensional buffer type
and the operations every layer above it needs. This is the foundation everything else in this
section is built from — `linalg`/`stats` never touch raw memory themselves, only `NDArray`.

```clojure
(defstruct NDArray
  (data  : (Vec F64) @ Region)   ; contiguous backing storage, arena-owned by whatever
                                  ; region the array itself was allocated in
  (shape : (Vec I32)  @ Region)  ; e.g. [3 4] for a 3x4 matrix
  (strides : (Vec I32) @ Region))

(defn zeros  [(shape : (Vec I32) @ :region/scratch) (dest : Arena @ Region)] : NDArray @ Region)
(defn from-vec [(data : (Vec F64) @ Region) (shape : (Vec I32) @ :region/scratch) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Result NDArray ShapeError) @ Region)
(defn get [(a : &NDArray) (idx : (Vec I32) @ :region/scratch)] : (Result F64 IndexError))
(defn set! [(a : &mut NDArray) (idx : (Vec I32) @ :region/scratch) (v : F64)] : (Result Unit IndexError))
(defn reshape [(a : &NDArray) (new-shape : (Vec I32) @ :region/scratch)] : (Result NDArray ShapeError) @ Region)
(defn add [(a : &NDArray) (b : &NDArray) (dest : Arena @ Region)] : (Result NDArray ShapeError) @ Region)
(defn mul-elementwise [(a : &NDArray) (b : &NDArray) (dest : Arena @ Region)] : (Result NDArray ShapeError) @ Region)
```

Every allocating function takes an explicit `dest : Arena @ Region` — same "caller picks the
region" idiom `io/open`/`string/concat` already use above, not a hidden global allocator the way
numpy's own C implementation has one. That's the actual place PARENA's version has to diverge
from numpy, not a cosmetic API difference: region typing means "where does this array live" is
part of every signature, not an implementation detail.

**`linalg`** — depends only on `array`, matches scipy's own `scipy.linalg` scope, not scipy's
full breadth:

```clojure
(defn matmul  [(a : &NDArray) (b : &NDArray) (dest : Arena @ Region)] : (Result NDArray ShapeError) @ Region)
(defn transpose [(a : &NDArray) (dest : Arena @ Region)] : NDArray @ Region)
(defn dot     [(a : &NDArray) (b : &NDArray)] : (Result F64 ShapeError))
(defn inverse [(a : &NDArray) (dest : Arena @ Region)] : (Result NDArray LinalgError) @ Region)
(defn solve   [(a : &NDArray) (b : &NDArray) (dest : Arena @ Region)] : (Result NDArray LinalgError) @ Region)
```

**`stats`** — depends only on `array`, matches scipy's own `scipy.stats` scope, deliberately
starting narrow (mean/std/summary statistics, not distributions/hypothesis-testing yet — those
are real, separate follow-up work once something actually needs them):

```clojure
(defn mean [(a : &NDArray)] : F64)
(defn std  [(a : &NDArray)] : F64)
(defn sum  [(a : &NDArray)] : F64)
(defn min  [(a : &NDArray)] : (Result F64 EmptyArrayError))
(defn max  [(a : &NDArray)] : (Result F64 EmptyArrayError))
```

**Real, honest limitation**: numpy/scipy's actual value is decades of vectorized, SIMD-tuned,
BLAS/LAPACK-backed numerical kernels — nothing above specifies *how* `matmul`/`inverse`/etc. get
implemented fast. A first real implementation would plausibly call out to a real BLAS/LAPACK C
library via the FFI block NORTHSTAR.md's own core idioms already show (`#target {:c (inline-c
...)}`), rather than hand-writing a naive triple-nested-loop matmul and calling it done — flagged
as a real follow-up decision, not resolved by this design pass.

### `dataframe` — the pandas equivalent, depends on `array` + `string`

Founder: "and pandas build pandas into the standard library." The one real thing that makes
pandas a different tool from numpy, not just numpy-with-more-functions: **heterogeneous, labeled,
tabular data** — a `DataFrame` column can be numbers or strings, columns have names, rows aren't
just an unlabeled index. That's the actual design constraint this package has to satisfy, not the
several hundred methods pandas' own `DataFrame` class accumulated over a decade.

```clojure
(defenum Column
  (NumericCol (data : NDArray @ Region))
  (StringCol  (data : (Vec String) @ Region)))

(defstruct DataFrame
  (columns : (Vec Column) @ Region)
  (column-names : (Vec String) @ Region)
  (row-count : I32))

(defn read-csv [(path : String @ :region/scratch) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Result DataFrame IoError) @ Region)
(defn column [(df : &DataFrame) (name : String @ :region/scratch)]
  : (Result (&Column) ColumnNotFoundError))
(defn select [(df : &DataFrame) (names : (Vec String) @ :region/scratch) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Result DataFrame ColumnNotFoundError) @ Region)
(defn filter [(df : &DataFrame) (pred : (Fn [I32] Bool)) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : DataFrame @ Region)
(defn group-by [(df : &DataFrame) (name : String @ :region/scratch) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Result (Vec DataFrame) ColumnNotFoundError) @ Region)
```

Deliberately **not** included: `merge`/`join` (real, needed eventually, but a genuinely bigger
design question — pandas' own join semantics are notoriously subtle around index alignment and
NaN handling — left for whoever actually needs cross-DataFrame joins to ground against a real use
case), pivot tables, and time-series-specific indexing (pandas' `DatetimeIndex` machinery is close
to its own subsystem, not a `dataframe`-package afterthought). `read-csv` is included because it's
the one I/O path every real pandas program starts from — without it this package can't even be
exercised by a real `.prn` program, the same "would be write-only without it" reasoning `buffer`'s
own `get-data` used above.

**Same honest limitation as `array`/`linalg`/`stats`**: a real fast CSV parser and a real
columnar-scan `filter`/`group-by` implementation are both genuine engineering, not specified by
the signatures above — flagged, not resolved here.

### `nn` / `tokenizer` / `sort` — grounded in porting `gpt2-alpine-c`

Founder: "add any more stdlib you can think of that would be needed to port gpt2alpinec." Not
speculative — read the real source (`/home/fatbaby/gpt2-alpine-c/src/`) rather than guessing what
a GPT-2 inference engine needs. It's a small, real C program: `gpt2.c`'s `gpt2_model_forward`
(the transformer forward pass) calls three static helpers by name — `layernorm`, `gelu_inplace`,
`softmax_inplace` — plus raw matmuls that `linalg` above already covers; `tokenizer.c` has
`tokenizer_load`/`gpt2_encode`/`gpt2_decode` (a real BPE-style tokenizer); `archetype.c` calls
`qsort` with a comparator for top-N ranking (the sampling-time top-k selection every GPT-2-style
decoder needs). Three small packages, matching those three real needs exactly — nothing extra.

**`nn`** — depends on `array` only, three primitives, not a full deep-learning framework:

```clojure
(defn layernorm [(x : &NDArray) (weight : &NDArray) (bias : &NDArray) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Result NDArray ShapeError) @ Region)
(defn gelu [(x : &NDArray) (dest : Arena @ Region)] : NDArray @ Region)
(defn softmax [(x : &NDArray) (dest : Arena @ Region)] : NDArray @ Region)
```

Deliberately **not** an `attention` or `transformer-block` function — `gpt2_model_forward` itself
composes attention from matmuls (`linalg/matmul`) + `softmax` + `layernorm`, not a single fused
call, and that composition is exactly the shape worth preserving: a program *using* `nn` builds
its own attention out of these primitives, the same way it's expected to build its own model
architecture. Baking "attention" in as one opaque stdlib call would hide the actual computation a
`gpt2-alpine-c` port needs to be honest about.

**`tokenizer`** — a real, stateful BPE tokenizer, matching `tokenizer_load`/`gpt2_encode`/
`gpt2_decode`'s own three-function shape exactly:

```clojure
(defn load [(vocab-path : String @ :region/scratch) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Result Tokenizer IoError) @ Region)
(defn encode [(!t : &Tokenizer) (text : String @ Region) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Result (Vec I32) TokenizeError) @ Region)
(defn decode [(!t : &Tokenizer) (ids : &(Vec I32)) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Result String TokenizeError) @ Region)
```

Unlike the source's own `tokenizer_load`/`tokenizer_free` pair (a global, process-lifetime
singleton — real C, but exactly the kind of hidden global state region typing exists to avoid), a
`Tokenizer` here is a real value with its own region, loaded once and passed explicitly to
`encode`/`decode` — no separate `free` function needed, since it's just an arena allocation like
everything else, reclaimed when its region ends.

**`sort`** — depends on nothing, generic over any `Vec`, grounded in `archetype.c`'s real
`qsort(sorted, ARCH_COUNT, sizeof(ArchetypeScore), score_cmp)` top-N-ranking use, which is exactly
what GPT-2-style sampling's top-k/top-p selection needs at generation time:

```clojure
(defn sort-by [(v : &mut (Vec T)) (cmp : (Fn [T T] I32))])
(defn top-k [(v : &(Vec T)) (k : I32) (cmp : (Fn [T T] I32)) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Vec T) @ Region)
```

Generic over `T` (not `NDArray`-specific) since `archetype.c`'s own comparator sorts a struct
(`ArchetypeScore`), not raw floats — a `sort` package tied to `array` would have been narrower
than the real C code it's meant to replace.

## Explicitly not designed yet — real gaps, not silently filled

- **Collections beyond `Vec`/`Map` literals** — `[...]`/`{...}` are core syntax (NORTHSTAR
  §"Syntax"), but no package for e.g. `vec/push`, `map/get` appears in any source example.
  Needed before anything past toy programs can be written; deliberately left for whoever
  actually writes the first real `.prn` program past `test.prn` to ground against real need,
  not guessed at here.
- **`net`** — nothing in the source spec or NORTHSTAR touches networking. Given PARENA's own
  GFD-mod-surface positioning (deferred per "build it pure"), this would eventually matter, but
  designing it now would be exactly the premature EduScript-integration thinking the founder's
  own sequencing explicitly said to avoid.
- **Cross-target divergence** — every signature above is written target-agnostic (`FileHandle`,
  not `int fd` or `java.io.RandomAccessFile`); NORTHSTAR's own "Multi-target compilation" table
  says C/JVM/TS/Wasm each get a different `Arena`-under-the-hood, but VS0 only targets C — how
  `io/open` maps to each target's real file-handle type is real, unstarted, target-specific work
  that only matters once a target beyond C exists.
