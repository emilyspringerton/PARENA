# PARENA Standard Library — design

**Status:** Design only. Nothing implemented — VS0 (`parena-c`) doesn't have a `defn`/`import`
resolver yet, so none of this can run. This document exists so the package boundaries are decided
*before* the region analyzer and emitter get built against them, not invented ad hoc later.

Founder: "PARENA needs a standard library like the golang one." Go's stdlib is the reference
point, applied at the level that actually transfers to a region-typed, multi-target language:
small, single-purpose packages; consistent per-package naming (`pkg.Func`-style, here
`pkg/func`); few surprises; `io`/`os`/`strings`/`fmt`-shaped coverage before anything exotic.
What does *not* transfer directly: Go's stdlib assumes a GC and no region system, so every
function signature below carries real `@ Region` annotations, not decoration.

## Real constraint this design has to satisfy

Five stdlib calls already exist as **real, load-bearing code** in `NORTHSTAR.md`'s own core-idiom
and VS0 examples — copied from the source spec document, not invented for this design pass:

```clojure
(string/parse-i32 input)                          ; safe-parse-int
(io/write-string !file "Operation completed\n")    ; write-log-and-close
(io/close !file)                                   ; write-log-and-close
(log/info "Parsed integer:" val)                   ; safe-parse-int
(buffer/set-data buf-arena bad-str)                ; VS0 test.prn's own invalid-escape example
```

Every package below either contains one of these five verbatim (with a real, specific type
signature now) or is new — and every new package is justified against something VS0's own DoD
or NORTHSTAR.md's own examples already need, not spec-crept in.

## Package list

### `core` — always in scope, no `import` needed

The handful of things every `.prn` file needs without asking for them, same role Go's
predeclared identifiers (`len`, `error`, `int`, `nil`) play.

- `(Option T)`, `(Result T E)` — the tagged unions `match` destructures (NORTHSTAR §"Zero-
  allocation pattern matching"). `Ok`/`Err`/`Some`/`None` constructors.
- `Arena`, `with-arena` — already core forms per NORTHSTAR's own "Declarations & bindings" and
  "Memory model" sections, not a package function, listed here only so this doc's own package
  list is complete.

### `io` — the two calls the source spec already uses, plus their obvious neighbors

```clojure
(defn write-string [(!f : FileHandle @ :region/task) (s : String @ :region/scratch)]
  : (Result Unit IoError) @ :region/scratch)

(defn close [(!f : FileHandle @ :region/task)]
  : (Result Unit IoError) @ :region/scratch)

(defn open [(path : String @ :region/scratch) (mode : OpenMode)]
  : (Result FileHandle IoError) @ :region/task)

(defn read-string [(!f : FileHandle @ :region/task) (buf : Arena @ :region/buffer)]
  : (Result String IoError) @ :region/buffer)
```

`write-string`/`close` take `!f` (linear) matching the source document's own
`write-log-and-close` example exactly — the region analyzer's move/ownership invariant is what
makes "write after close" a compile error, not a runtime check `io` has to perform itself.
`open`/`read-string` are the obvious symmetric operations no `io` package could ship without,
grounded in the same `FileHandle` type the source examples already assume exists.

### `string` — one real call, plus the minimum a "no arrays yet but has Strings" language needs

```clojure
(defn parse-i32 [(s : String @ :region/scratch)]
  : (Result I32 ParseError) @ :region/scratch)

(defn length [(s : String @ :region/scratch)] : I32)
(defn concat [(a : String @ Region) (b : String @ Region) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : String @ Region)
(defn split [(s : String @ :region/scratch) (sep : String @ :region/scratch) (dest : Arena @ Region)]
  : (Vec String) @ Region)
```

`parse-i32` is verbatim from the source spec (`safe-parse-int`'s own body). `length`/`concat`/
`split` are the minimum any language ships before its first real program can be written that
does more than log a fixed string — deliberately small, not a full `strings`-package-worth of
surface, matching "yolo like php" over speccing every function up front.

### `log` — one real call

```clojure
(defn info  [(msg : String @ Region) (args : &Any ...)])
(defn warn  [(msg : String @ Region) (args : &Any ...)])
(defn error [(msg : String @ Region) (args : &Any ...)])
```

`info` is verbatim from the source spec. `warn`/`error` are the obvious same-shape siblings —
not adding a full leveled-logging framework (formatters, sinks, structured fields) until
something real needs one.

### `buffer` — one real call, the arena-adjacent operations `Arena`/`with-arena` alone don't cover

```clojure
(defn set-data [(!buf : Arena @ :region/buffer) (data : String @ Region)]
  : (Result Unit RegionError) @ :region/buffer)

(defn get-data [(buf : Arena @ :region/buffer)] : (Option String) @ :region/buffer)
```

`set-data` is verbatim from VS0's own `test.prn` (both the valid and the deliberately-invalid
example call it). `get-data` is the obvious read-side counterpart — without it, `buffer` would
be a write-only package, which no real stdlib package is.

## Explicitly not designed yet — real gaps, not silently filled

- **`math`** — no numeric operation beyond literal integers/decimals appears anywhere in the
  source spec. Needed eventually (every real language ships one), not scoped here because
  nothing concrete grounds a specific function list yet.
- **Collections beyond `Vec`/`Map` literals** — `[...]`/`{...}` are core syntax (NORTHSTAR
  §"Syntax"), but no package for e.g. `vec/push`, `map/get` appears in any source example.
  Needed before anything past toy programs can be written; deliberately left for whoever
  actually writes the first real `.prn` program past `test.prn` to ground against real need,
  not guessed at here.
- **`net`** — nothing in the source spec or NORTHSTAR touches networking. Given PARENA's own
  GFD-mod-surface positioning (deferred per "build it pure"), this would eventually matter, but
  designing it now would be exactly the premature EduScript-integration thinking the founder's
  own sequencing explicitly said to avoid.
- **Cross-target divergence** — every signature above is written target-agnostic (`FileHandle`,
  not `int fd` or `java.io.RandomAccessFile`); NORTHSTAR's own "Multi-target compilation" table
  says C/JVM/TS/Wasm each get a different `Arena`-under-the-hood, but VS0 only targets C — how
  `io/open` maps to each target's real file-handle type is real, unstarted, target-specific work
  that only matters once a target beyond C exists.
